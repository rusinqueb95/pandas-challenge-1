#summary - In this assignment, we had a bunch of data and had to organize it neatly using a program called JupyterLab. We did things like adding up how much stuff different clients bought, how much they paid for shipping, and how much money they made overall. Sometimes we ran into problems, but by figuring out what went wrong and fixing it, we learned more about how to work with data using Python.
